        MORANZONE

   What of thy murdered father?<br>

GUIDO<br>

   Dost thou think
   My father would be glad to see me coming,
   This old man’s blood still hot upon mine hands?<br>

MORANZONE<br>

   Ay! he would laugh for joy.<br>

GUIDO<br>

   I do not think so,
   There is better knowledge in the other world;
   Vengeance is God’s, let God himself revenge.<br>

MORANZONE<br>

   Thou art God’s minister of vengeance.<br>

GUIDO<br>

   No!
   God hath no minister but his own hand.
   I will not kill this man.<br>

MORANZONE<br>

   Why are you here,
   If not to kill him, then?<br>

GUIDO<br>

   Lord Moranzone,
   I purpose to ascend to the Duke’s chamber,
   And as he lies asleep lay on his breast
   The dagger and this writing; when he awakes
   Then he will know who held him in his power
   And slew him not: this is the noblest vengeance
   Which I can take.
