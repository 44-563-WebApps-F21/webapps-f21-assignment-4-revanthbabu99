 <h3>MORANZONE</h3>

 <p id="speech"> What of thy murdered father?</p>

<h3>GUIDO</h3>

<p id="speech">   Dost thou think
   My father would be glad to see me coming,
   This old man’s blood still hot upon mine hands?</p>

<h3>MORANZONE</h3>

  <p id="speech"> Ay! he would laugh for joy.</p>

  <h3>GUIDO</h3>

  <p id="speech"> I do not think so,
   There is better knowledge in the other world;
   Vengeance is God’s, let God himself revenge.</p>

   <h3>MORANZONE</h3>

   <p id="speech">Thou art God’s minister of vengeance.</p>

   <h3>GUIDO</h3>

   <p id="speech"> No!
   God hath no minister but his own hand.
   I will not kill this man.</p>

   <h3>MORANZONE</h3>
   <p id="speech"> Why are you here,
   If not to kill him, then?</p>

   <h3>GUIDO</h3>

   <p id="speech">  Lord Moranzone,
   I purpose to ascend to the Duke’s chamber,
   And as he lies asleep lay on his breast
   The dagger and this writing; when he awakes
   Then he will know who held him in his power
   And slew him not: this is the noblest vengeance
   Which I can take.4
